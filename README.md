# Statistics for Machine Learning in Go

This repository aims to contain the code snippets of the book [Statistics for Machine Learning of Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/statistics-machine-learning) but written in Go, rather than Python and R.

## License

All the source code keeps the same license as the original source written in Python and R, although I haven't been able to find under which terms the sources are released, the book is under the Packt Publishing Copyright, so the contest of this repository doesn't aim nor change them and don't try to reproduce any part of the book, just only used the examples to experiment how the Go language looks like for Statistics Machine Learning calculation.

In case that there is any problem legally with this work, don't hesitate to open an issue.
